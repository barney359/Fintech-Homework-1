Mini Case Study
# FinTech Case Study
## Overview & Origin
This case study is to dive into the Robinhood phenomenon. Robinhood is one of the most successful Fintech companies in the wealth management space. Robinhood has been able to captivate young investors with their easy-to-use trading platform, no trading fees for stocks and ETFs and low margin rates. This young company set out to democratize the industry has made its presence felt among the largest discount brokerage firms as many firms have followed their lead by removing trading fees. While still in a hyper growth phase, Robinhood still faces many challenges to become a mainstay for decades to come. Among which are, low wallet share, high risk option trading, “activist traders, ” negative PR from untimely customer service etc. In this case study we will examine where Robinhood’s past, present and future. 

*Name of Company
Robinhood Markets, Robinhood Financial LLC

*When was the company incorporated? 
April 18, 2013

*Who are the founders of the company? 
Vladmir Tenev & Baiju Bhatt

*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
Founders and former roommates Vladmir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt discovered Wall Street firms paid next to nothing to trade while building trading platforms and selling them to hedge funds in New York City. A couple years spent in New York lead to the founders moving back to California to build Robinhood so that everyone could have access to financial markets. 

*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
Robinhood has been funded by 13 series investment rounds that have totaled $5.6 billion from 2013 when they received $3 million in seed money to the most recent fund raise of $2.4 billion on January 31, 2021. See the table below for more funding details. 

## Activities
*What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Robinhood has lowered the barriers to entry to financial markets by having low to no fees on all trade types, low margin rates, and a very user-friendly interface. The discount brokerage industry has responded by with firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and E*TRADE removing trading fees for stocks and ETFs.  

*Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Robinhood’s target demographic is the millennial generation (ages 23-38 years old) which makes up 72.1 million people in the US. The company has captivated their target demo with the average Robinhood user being between the ages of 28-41. It’s main appeal is that they offer all other products or services that other firms do at lower costs. The only service Robinhood offers that other discount brokerage firms do not is the ability to purchase Cryptocurrency. It’s appeal has also been fueled by the way they have been able to break into their target demographic by creating a marketing strategy that is riding the wave of socio-economic activism that has characterized the generation over the past 10 years from Occupy Wall Street back in 2011 to present day civil rights activism.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking & Investment Management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Over the past 5-10 years the major players in the industry have competed mostly through cost. Competitors like TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Etrade, Trade Station, and Fidelity consistently lower trading cost to gain a leg up. Until last year Robinhood set an industry standard amongst the major players by removing commissions on stock and ETF trades. This was followed quickly by, Schwab, TD and Fidelity. 

Furthermore, all discount brokerage firms compete for wallet share by offering, additional cash up-front, if clients bring in new assets and hold them at the institution for longer than 90 days. The fight for wallet share has caused for many firms to create proprietary trading asset allocations and robo advisors to help clients with not as much trading experience. 
No cost ETF and Equity trades

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade
Fidelity
Trade Station
Interactive Brokers
SoFi
Vanguard
ETrade
M1Finance
Moomoo
WeBull


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Thus far Robinhood’s mission to democratize the industry has been amazingly effective. It’s easy to use platforms, no account minimums, no-low trading commissions, and low barriers to high-risk trading has caused Robinhood to have over 20 million users in just 8 years of business. Robinhood’s no-low commissions has caused the rest of the industry to respond and lower fees themselves to remain competitive. 

They have done an excellent job at galvanizing younger generations and offer many educational tools that allow for traders/investors to gain access to information before placing trades.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The 3 main categories used to measure success are the following

Number of users
Wallet Share
Total Assets 

While Robinhood is doing exceptionally well in growing its number of users total assets measures do not coincide with the number of users although it is on an upward trajectory the average Robinhood users account balance it below 5k. This conversation carries over to wallet share for each Robinhood user being less than 8% of total assets per client. 

Considering Robinhood still only offers an individual brokerage account, they are doing extraordinarily well. They will need to start considering different account type offerings to start to increase that low number. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Robinhood should look to increase wallet share among its current and future user base by doing each of the following steps: 
1.	Increase account type offerings – Over the next 20 years our country is going to be experiencing a large wealth transfer from the baby boomer generation to Gen Y and Millennials. To position itself to be a benefactor of the times it is important for Robinhood to offer, Estate Accounts, Trust accounts, Joint Accounts, IRAs, Inherited IRAs etc, and business retirement accounts as well. 
2.	Offer financial planning tools that can help users maintain their financial lives. Although financial planning is a discipline all to itself many financial planning principles can be very simply followed and automated. 
3.	Increase the barrier to entry for high-risk option and margin trading. Despite the idea being to offer the types of trading to masses that once only available to the richest few, more and more people will continue to lose exponential amounts of money thinking that they know what they are doing. They should create an interactive test for folks who may not meet minimum options trading requirements to ensure Robinhood is doing enough to ensure clients understand the dangers of high risk trading. 
4.	Offer trade models that allow for users purchase securities and set investment parameters for those trades. This will allow for users to be in the drivers set of the investing but have the option to put things on autopilot. Competitors such as M1 Finance have similar technologies but do not have the brand recognition, users, or simple interface.


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The first step would be to increase the account type offering. This will help do a number on increasing wallet share. 

Next by offering financial planning tools this will help client’s feel more comfortable using Robinhood for more than play money. Companies like ETrade were never able to break the stigma of being an online stock trading platform, despite the vast area products or services. If you automate financial planning, eliminating the need for a financial planner or wealth managers this allows for savvy and not so savvy investors to take advantage of all Robinhood has to offer. *could charge for this service to increase revenues

Furthermore, with the increasing asset level users will hold at Robinhood they will need to limit their exposure to suit by making it a bit more difficult for users to engage in high-risk trading. Conducting short quizzes for people who may be on the border line with options/margin trading experience, knowledge or asset level should have to prove that they; 1. understand risk of uncovered call writing and; 2. Have the assets or cash to cover such trades elsewhere. 

The last option is a way for Robinhood to dip its toe in to asset management without managing the assets. This gives the user all the control but still provides a framework that could assist the user by automating buying, selling and holding decisions that could help increase returns and limit downside risk. *could charge for this service to increase revenues
  


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The same technologies used by Robinhood currently could be used to implement all strategies. Python code using conditionals could be used to program increased options level risk parameters, short quizzes, trading algorithms can be written allowing for the user to input solutions to manage their portfolios according to the parameters set in the algo. 
 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are appropriate because one of Robinhood’s major strengths is its user friendly interface. Altering what they are doing too much could result in messing up the user experience. If anything, perhaps creating a separate financial planning application that can be used in conjunction with the Robinhood app maybe an option.
